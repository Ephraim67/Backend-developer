# What you’re trying to achieve (short)

When a guest opens the app, the system should return a ranked list of hotels near the guest’s current location, taking into account:

* **Proximity** (closest first),
* **Hotel quality / popularity** (rating, bookings),
* **Personalization** (guest’s past preferences, history),
* **Business constraints** (availability, price range, promotions).



# High-level approach (recommended)

Use a **hybrid** system:

1. **Geospatial filter** (fast, real-time): find hotels within radius R using geospatial index.
2. **Candidate scoring / ranking** (real-time): compute a combined score from distance, popularity, personalization model, availability, price.
3. **Personalization model** (offline + online): collaborative filtering or content-based model to produce a personalization score per hotel for each user.
4. **Serve & cache**: return top-K results; cache popular queries; A/B test ranking functions.



# Data you’ll need

* Hotel data: `hotel_id, name, lat, lon, type, price, rating, popularity_metrics (bookings_count), amenities, room_availability`.
* User data: `user_id, location_history, bookings_history, preferences (room_type, price_range), device_locale`.
* Interaction logs: search requests, clicks, views, bookings, cancellations, time stamps.
* Context: time of day, check-in/check-out dates, current device location, active promotions.



# Feature ideas

* **Distance** = haversine(lat\_user, lon\_user, lat\_hotel, lon\_hotel).
* **Normalized rating** (0–1).
* **Normalized popularity** (bookings / visits).
* **Personalization score** (from CF or neural model).
* **Price match score** for user’s price range.
* **Availability flag** (0/1).
* **Time decay features** (recent bookings > older bookings).



# Candidate generation (fast)

* Use a geospatial index (PostGIS, MongoDB geo, Elasticsearch geo\_point) to fetch hotels within e.g. 10 km or top 200 nearest.
* This is your candidate set for scoring.



# Scoring function (simple hybrid example)

A simple real-time ranking score (explainable) is ok for an MVP:

```
score = α * (1 - normalized_distance) 
      + β * normalized_rating
      + γ * normalized_popularity
      + δ * personalization_score
      + ε * availability_flag
```

Tune α..ε via offline validation or A/B testing.



# Model options for personalization

1. **Content-based**: compute similarity between hotel features and user profile (good for cold start).
2. **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: matrix factorization (ALS) or implicit feedback (Spotify-style) to predict user-hotel affinity.
3. **Factorization Machines / LightGBM**: use cross features (user × hotel) for richer signals.
4. **Neural Ranking**: a two-tower model (user tower, item tower) for embeddings + dot product for real-time scoring.
5. **Learning-to-rank** (LambdaMART): learn final ranking using features above (distance, rating, personalization embedding, etc.)

For most hotel apps, start with CF + simple distance weighting, then upgrade to learning-to-rank.



# Offline training pipeline

1. Ingest interaction logs into a data lake (S3) or warehouse (BigQuery/Redshift).
2. Preprocess to produce user-item interaction matrix and features.
3. Train CF/embedding models (ALS or two-tower/triplet loss).
4. Train a ranking model (LambdaMART/LightGBM) that learns to combine distance & personalization.
5. Validate with metrics: **Precision\@K, Recall\@K, NDCG\@K, MRR** and business metrics (bookings, revenue lift).



# Real-time serving architecture

* **Feature store**: store precomputed personalization embeddings & hotel features (Redis / Faiss for ANN).

* **API flow**:

  1. Frontend sends user\_id (if logged in) and `lat/lon`.
  2. Backend queries geo index → returns candidates (top N).
  3. Backend fetches hotel features & user embedding.
  4. Compute personalization score (embedding dot product) and distance → compute final score.
  5. Return top K hotels to client.

* Use caching for repeated queries (same location, popular hotels).



# Handling cold start

* New user: rely on **distance + popularity + content matching** (e.g., show best-rated and closest).
* New hotel: use content/features and promotions to surface it.



# Privacy & safety

* Ask permission to use precise location, provide a fallback radius-based search.
* Comply with local laws (GDPR-ish): store minimal data, give opt-out for personalization.
* Secure tokens, encrypt PII at rest.



# Evaluation & experimentation

* Offline: Precision\@5, NDCG\@5, AUC for pairwise ranking.
* Online: A/B test alternative scoring functions and models; monitor booking conversion rate, CTR, revenue per search.
* KPIs: booking conversion, average distance to booked hotel, time-to-book.



# Simple example — practical code snippets

### 1) Haversine function (JS) — compute distance quickly

```js
function haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const toRad = x => (x * Math.PI) / 180;
  const R = 6371; // km
  const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1), dLon = toRad(lon2 - lon1);
  const a = Math.sin(dLat/2)**2 + Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) * Math.sin(dLon/2)**2;
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  return R * c; // distance in km
}
```

### 2) Simple Node.js ranking example (after you fetch candidates from DB)

```js
// candidates: [{hotel_id, lat, lon, rating, popularity, price, availability}, ...]
function rankHotels(user, candidates) {
  const maxDist = 10; // km for normalization
  const alpha = 0.6, beta = 0.2, gamma = 0.1, delta = 0.1;
  return candidates.map(h => {
    const dist = haversine(user.lat, user.lon, h.lat, h.lon);
    const normDist = Math.min(dist, maxDist) / maxDist; // 0..1
    const normRating = h.rating / 5; // assuming 1..5
    const normPopularity = Math.tanh(h.popularity / 100); // example
    const personalizationScore = user.embedding ? dot(user.embedding, h.embedding) : 0; // precomputed embeddings
    const score = alpha * (1 - normDist) + beta * normRating + gamma * normPopularity + delta * personalizationScore + (h.availability ? 0.05 : -0.2);
    return {...h, score};
  }).sort((a,b) => b.score - a.score);
}
```

### 3) Quick Python sketch: candidate personalization via embeddings (offline)

```py
# user_embeddings.npy, hotel_embeddings.npy loaded as arrays
# compute dot product to get similarity
import numpy as np
def personalization(user_vec, hotel_matrix):
    sims = hotel_matrix @ user_vec  # fast matrix multiply
    return sims  # higher = more relevant
```



# Tech stack recommendations

# Roadmap (practical steps)

2. **Logging (week 1–2)**: collect interaction logs (views, clicks, bookings).
3. **Simple personalization (week 2–3)**: train item popularity/time-decay and user preference vector (content-based).
4. **CF/embeddings (week 3–5)**: build collaborative filtering (ALS or two-tower), store embeddings.
5. **Hybrid ranker (week 5–7)**: train a learning-to-rank model combining features, roll out A/B test.
6. **Scale & productionize (ongoing)**: caching, ANN, monitoring, privacy reviews.

# Risks & gotchas

* Location inaccuracy → use some tolerance; ask user to confirm.
* Bias toward popular hotels → tune to expose new listings fairly.
* Latency if fetching many features → precompute embeddings and cache hotel features.
