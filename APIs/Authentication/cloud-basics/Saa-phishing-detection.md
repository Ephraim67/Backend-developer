# üß† High-Level Business Goal

**Offer a SaaS service** that **monitors Outlook (M365) mailboxes** for your customers  
and **detects/blocks** phishing attempts *before* users click.

‚úÖ Works for **multiple tenants** (companies).  
‚úÖ Scales cleanly.  
‚úÖ Secure by design (can't be easily spoofed or hacked).  

---

# üî• Architecture Overview (Big Blocks)

1. **OAuth2 Authorization**  
2. **Graph API for Reading Emails**  
3. **Subscriptions/Webhooks** (to track *new* messages instantly)  
4. **Secure Webhook Handling** (signature checking + timestamps)  
5. **Multi-Tenant Data Model** (tenant isolation using RLS/shared DBs)  
6. **Phishing Detection Engine** (custom ML or heuristic rules)
7. **Admin Portal for Customers** (dashboard)
8. **SPF/DKIM/DMARC Analysis** (if applicable)
9. **Alerting/Remediation** (move suspicious emails to Quarantine or notify user/admin)

# üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Plan

---

### 1. Authenticate Customers (OAuth2 + Microsoft Identity Platform)

- Customers install your app.
- They **consent** to allow your app to access their **email via Graph API**.
- You get an **access token** + **refresh token** per tenant.

‚úÖ Use **Delegated** or **Application** permissions.  
‚úÖ Store encrypted tokens safely (per tenant).

OAuth Scopes needed:

```text
Mail.Read
Mail.ReadWrite
MailboxSettings.Read
offline_access
```

(For more control, also `Mail.ReadWrite` to **move** suspicious emails later.)

---

### 2. Subscribe to New Emails (Graph Webhooks)

- For each tenant, set up **Graph subscriptions** on:
  - `/me/mailFolders('Inbox')/messages`
  - Or better: `/users/{userId}/mailFolders('Inbox')/messages`

- Webhook triggered **instantly** when new email arrives.

‚úÖ You can catch phishing BEFORE user clicks.

---

### 3. Webhook Receiver (with Secure Verification)

- Set up a public HTTPS endpoint.
- Secure it:
  - **Signature verification** (e.g., HMAC)
  - **Timestamp checking** (prevent replay attacks)
  - **TLS enforced** (HTTPS only)

‚úÖ Reject invalid webhook requests.

---

### 4. Pull New Email Metadata (Using Graph API)

Once webhook triggers:

- Pull **email metadata** quickly (subject, sender, headers, body).
- Do NOT trust webhook payload alone ‚Äî **re-fetch** securely from Graph.

---

### 5. Analyze Email for Phishing (Detection Engine)

Options:

- **Fast Heuristics** (first version)
  - Suspicious subject line
  - Spoofed sender domain
  - DMARC/SPF/DKIM fail
  - Known bad IPs/URLs
  - Language like "urgent", "payment", "password", "verify account"
- **Advanced ML** (later versions)
  - Natural language processing
  - Threat intel feeds
  - Attachment sandboxing

‚úÖ First build **simple rule-based filters**, evolve to **machine learning**.

---

### 6. Remediation

If phishing detected:

- Option 1: **Move email** to user's "Quarantine" folder (via Graph API `move` action).
- Option 2: **Delete or Flag** the email.
- Option 3: **Send Alert** to Admin Dashboard.

‚úÖ Only take destructive action if the tenant opted in.

---

### 7. Tenant Isolation (Multi-Tenant Architecture)

Use Shared DB + Row Level Security:

- Each customer (tenant) identified by `tenant_id`.
- All tables (`users`, `emails`, `alerts`) have `tenant_id` field.
- Enforce RLS in the database to guarantee clean data isolation.

‚úÖ Critical to avoid cross-tenant data leaks.

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard (for Customer Visibility)

Each customer admin can:

- View alerts (phishing incidents)
- See email analytics (phishing rate, user risk)
- Configure detection sensitivity
- View webhook subscription health

‚úÖ Keep dashboard lightweight at first (Node.js + React is perfect).

---

### 9. Monitor Your Subscriptions

Graph API subscriptions expire after ~1-3 days.  
‚úÖ You MUST have a **background job** that **auto-renews** subscriptions every day.

# üè¢ Hosting / Infrastructure

- **API Server** (Node.js / NestJS) ‚Äî handles auth, webhooks, Graph API
- **Database** (PostgreSQL) ‚Äî shared DB + RLS per tenant
- **Frontend** (Next.js / React) ‚Äî customer portal
- **Background Workers** (for subscription renewals, delayed analysis)
- **Monitoring** (CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.)

Run it all on:

‚úÖ AWS / Azure / GCP (any works)  
‚úÖ Use Kubernetes or serverless if you want hyper scaling later

# üéØ Final Thoughts

‚úÖ **Start simple** with rule-based detection.  
‚úÖ **Automate** subscription management from day 1.  
‚úÖ **Secure webhooks** *very tightly*.  
‚úÖ **Tenant isolation** is critical ‚Äî invest time here.  
‚úÖ **Alerts and visibility** will make customers trust your service.
