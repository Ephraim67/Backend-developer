# 🧠 What is DKIM?

**DKIM** is an email security mechanism that:

- **Digitally signs** your email.
- **Proves** that the email really came from your domain and wasn't **modified** along the way.

✅ DKIM gives **cryptographic proof** that the sender is authorized and that the message content is intact.

---

# 🌐 How DKIM Works (Simple Flow)

1. When you send an email, **your server** **adds a signature** to the email header.
2. The signature is based on:
   - Some parts of the email (like From, Subject, Body).
   - A **private key** that only your server owns.
3. Receiver gets the email.
4. Receiver looks up your **public key** in your domain’s **DNS**.
5. Receiver verifies that:
   - The email signature is valid (meaning: you really sent it).
   - The email wasn't changed in transit.

# 🔥 Example Real Email with DKIM

When you look at email headers (like in Gmail), you'll see:

```
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=example.com; s=selector1;
 h=from:subject:date:to;
 bh=dXJkOGFmb2xpa3M=;
 b=abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef==
```

✅ `d=example.com` → domain being verified  
✅ `s=selector1` → which key to use from DNS  
✅ `b=...` → the actual digital signature  

---

# 📦 Where is DKIM Set?

- You **publish a special DNS TXT record** for your domain.
- Example DNS record:

```dns
selector1._domainkey.example.com  IN  TXT  "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFA..."
```

- `selector1` → lets you rotate keys easily (you can have multiple selectors).
- `p=...` → your **public key**.

---

# 🔥 Step-by-Step How DKIM Actually Happens

1. Your server (SMTP server, Office365, Google, etc.) **creates** a signature.
2. It **signs** parts of the email (From, Subject, etc.) using your private key.
3. Sends email with `DKIM-Signature` header.
4. Receiver:
   - Extracts the DKIM header.
   - Looks up your **public key** via DNS.
   - Verifies the signature.

If everything matches → DKIM **Pass** ✅

If tampered with → DKIM **Fail** ❌

# 🛡️ Why DKIM Matters

- **Authenticates** the real sender.
- **Prevents** email tampering.
- **Improves** deliverability (you look trusted to Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
- **Essential** for passing DMARC (which enforces SPF/DKIM).

# ✅ vs ❌ DKIM Results

| Result  | Meaning                                  |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
| Pass    | Signature is valid and verified          |
| Fail    | Signature is invalid or missing          |

---

# 🎯 Example Scenario

You own `yourcompany.com`.

You set up your email sending server with DKIM.

Your DNS will have something like:

```dns
selector1._domainkey.yourcompany.com  TXT  "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBg..."
```

When you send emails, your mail server signs each email with your private key.  
Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo can validate it with your public key from DNS.

# ⚡ Important Terms:

| Term         | Meaning                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Selector     | A label to find the right DKIM key       |
| Public key   | Stored in DNS for verification           |
| Private key  | Secret, used by your mail server to sign |
| Header Canonicalization | Normalizes headers to prevent minor formatting changes from breaking DKIM |

---

# Super Simple Visual Flow

```
Your Server
    🔒 [Private Key] Sign email
    ➡️ Send email with DKIM-Signature header
Receiving Server
    🔎 [Public Key] Check signature
    ✅ If match → Pass
    ❌ If broken → Fail
```

---

# 🛠️ Setting up DKIM (Real World)

1. **Enable DKIM** on your email platform (Office365, Google Workspace, SendGrid, etc.).
2. **Generate keys** (or your platform will give them to you).
3. **Publish** the **public key** as a DNS TXT record.
4. **Test** with online tools (`mxtoolbox.com/dkim.aspx`).

# 🔥 Bonus Tip: How to View DKIM on an Email

- In Gmail → "Show Original" → search for `DKIM-Signature`  
- You’ll see if DKIM **pass** or **fail**.

| SPF                             | DKIM                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Checks which server can send     | Checks that the message is untouched   |
| DNS record lists IPs             | DNS record lists public keys           |
| Protects from unauthorized senders | Protects from tampering and forgery    |
