* **Node.js** is like a program that lets you run **JavaScript outside of a browser** (normally, JavaScript only works inside websites).

* It’s **open-source and works on all major operating systems** (Windows, Mac, Linux).

* Under the hood, it uses the same engine that powers **Google Chrome’s JavaScript** (called **V8**) — that’s why it’s super fast.

* Normally, when a program handles many users, it creates a **new worker (thread)** for each user, which can get heavy. But **Node.js handles everything in one process** and uses a clever system to manage multiple users at once.

* The key trick is that Node.js uses **non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O**. That means:

  * Instead of waiting for one task to finish (like reading a file or talking to a database), it **keeps working on other tasks** in the meantime.
  * Think of a restaurant: instead of one waiter serving one customer at a time, the waiter can take multiple orders and deliver them as soon as they’re ready, without being stuck waiting in the kitchen.



**Node.js is like a fast, multitasking waiter that uses JavaScript outside the browser to handle many requests at once without slowing down.**
